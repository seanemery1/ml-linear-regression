## PROJECT INFORMATION
Pending...

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
1) run runLinearRegression to generate data and graphs using MatLab's built in linear regression and custom (from-scratch) linear regression.

## FUNCTIONS
1) cleanDataFeatSelect.m\
cleans data (ie. seperating categorical data into dummy variables) and removes bad features

2) gradDescent.m\
from-scratch, custom gradient descent algorithm

3) cost.m\
sub function that calculates the cost (for gradient descent)

4) gradDescentLasso\
from-scratch, custom gradient descent with lasso algorithm for feature selection

5) lassoInterpretor.m\
processes the outputs of MatLab's lasso function into a table with remaining features (and their headers)

6) regressXY.m\
compares and graphs the relationship between X and Y (ie. two features)
